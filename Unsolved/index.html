      <p>
        I'm based out of Calgary, AB.  I'm a Master Electrician from a former life.<br>
        During this time I loved industrial controls and Programmable Logic Controllers.<br>
        I moved onto partnering with my wife with all things IT and organizational with our business in the Financial arena.<br>
        I'm in this class to - finally - learn what I was always passionate about, programming computers.
      </p>
      <p>As a young man I played on the BMX.<br>
        Since then, I play the guitar.<br>
        In the future, I will play shuffleboard and bingo.</p>
